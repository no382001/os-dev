- it can bootstrap

- standardize stdout/in

- fvm shell
  - strings

- crc and loading dynamic kernel size
- inconsistent type usage

- think about optimizations
  - dont link unused code atleast
  - -O1 crashes when interacting w/ ata
  - libc opt


forth:
  - comments and docu struct for each registered word
    - load on initrd from a file 
  - strings
  - fileio integration

fileio:
  - open/ write

fs:
  long filename
  ext2 support?

build disk:
  on generation save the img, remove it from clean and keep backups
  when trying to generate new one, make a file comparator that shows the differences in file

- basic vim

notes:
- make sure that the function really takes va_list and not just ... bc its UB
- static memory fails sometimes, misaligned and corrupted .bss?
    [#0] 0x13ab7 → memset(dest=0x186d0 <backbuffer+352> "", val=0x1, len=0x9600)
    [#1] 0x101ca → kernel_main()
    - workaround is to expose the stack variable to a global ptr

- aligned labels
mmaps and the  fkcuing bios tyring to use some address that is not mapped by me



convert to cooperative multitaskin:
 - detach the timer from the scheduler put it on the separate 0x30 interrupt vecotr
 - adjust the linker file, put heap on _end
 - maybe the supposed quemu bios 0xC08* shit will go away?
