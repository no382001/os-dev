- it can bootstrap

- fileio/ open/ write
  - basic vim

- standardize stdout/in

- fvm shell
  - strings

- crc and loading dynamic kernel size
- inconsistent type usage

- think about optimizations
  - dont link unused code atleast
  - -O1 crashes when interacting w/ ata
  - libc opt

notes:
- make sure that the function really takes va_list and not just ... bc its UB
- static memory fails sometimes, misaligned and corrupted .bss?
    [#0] 0x13ab7 → memset(dest=0x186d0 <backbuffer+352> "", val=0x1, len=0x9600)
    [#1] 0x101ca → kernel_main()
    - workaround is to expose the stack variable to a global ptr
